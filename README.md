## üöÄ Getting Started

To start on your journey with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RyanQchiqache/Machine-Learning-Learning-Center.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd Machine-Learning-Learning-Center
    ```
3. **Install the required libraries**:
    You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow torch
    ```
    Or with conda if you are using the Anaconda distribution:
    ```sh
    conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow torch
    ```
4. **Run Jupyter notebooks**:
    Make sure you have Jupyter installed and run:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
   
## üñ•Ô∏è Creating a Virtual Environment (venv)

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for your project, it's recommended to use a Python virtual environment. Follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv my_env
    ```
   Here, `my_env` is the name of your virtual environment directory.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     .\my_env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source my_env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required libraries** (within the activated virtual environment):
    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow torch
    ```

4. **Deactivate the virtual environment** when you're done working:
    ```sh
    deactivate
    ```
